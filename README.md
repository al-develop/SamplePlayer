# SamplePlayer
A small WPF and MVVM Application to run samples (short music files) to check, what they sound like before actually using them in a song.

First you need to open the folder, where your samples are located. This folder can also contain subfolders with more samples.
Alternativly, you can enter the path directly into the TextBox and press "Enter".
Then you can run a sample by clicking on it.
